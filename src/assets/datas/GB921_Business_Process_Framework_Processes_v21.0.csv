Defining customer journeys also provides a more clear set of milestones and goals to benchmark customer progress.
The overall scope of the CLM process encompasses the entire organization, which generally brings all sources of static and dynamic data, marketing processes, and value-added services to a unified decision supporting platform through iterative phases of customer acquisition, retention, cross- and upselling, and lapsed customer win-back.
Processes are put into place to support customers, therefore the first step is to understand customers in several dimensions, including:
•{T}The customer needs
•{T}The customer processes
•{T}Customer ""events,"" where the customer comes into contact with the organization
•{T}The experience that the customer values

The next step is to work forward from the customer to define the organization’s processes. This approach builds the customer’s view into the process; it ensures that the process delivers the experience—and the value—that the customer wants.
Value is essentially determined by the customer. Therefore, process design begins with the customer’s viewpoint, an understanding of what the customer truly values, and an understanding of the new communications technologies and value-added services that provide customer value.
The benefits of a customer-driven approach cross all levels of an organization, from increased employee satisfaction to increased shareholder value. A customer-driven approach fosters the development of customer-focused processes and helps instill ownership of processes by allowing individuals to own and solve their own needs. This enables better alignment of responsibility and accountability with authority.

The objectives of these processes are to efficiently and effectively manage reported resource trouble, isolate the root cause and act to resolve the resource trouble. 

Responsibilities of the Resource Trouble Management processes include, but are not limited to:

• Detecting, analyzing, managing and reporting on resource alarm event notifications; 
• Initiating and managing resource trouble reports;
• Performing resource trouble localization analysis; 
• Correcting and resolving resource trouble;
• Reporting progress on resource trouble reports to other processes;
• Assigning & tracking resource trouble testing and repair activities 
• Managing resource trouble jeopardy conditions.

On one hand, resource troubles may relate to Problems in the Service domain and therefore also potentially in the customer domain. On the other hand, they may relate to specific resource failures or performance degradations, which are caused by resource faults.
As such, the Resource Trouble Management processes work with specific resource alarm event notifications received from Resource Data Collection & Distribution, specific resource performance notifications from Resource Performance Management, and potential specific resource trouble notifications from Service Problem Management processes.

Resource Trouble Management processes perform analysis, decide on the appropriate actions/responses and carry them out with the intent of restoring normal operation on specific resources. 
However these activities need to interact with the Service Problem Management processes, as the latter have a view on service impact.

• Performing resource alarm event notification localization analysis; 
• Correlating and filtering resource alarm event records;
• Reporting resource alarm event record status changes to other processes
• Managing resource alarm event record jeopardy conditions.

Resource alarm event notification analysis encompasses the identification of the resource alarm event in terms of reporting entity and nature of the resource alarm event.

It includes the notification of new resource alarm event records, or status changes of previously reported resource alarm event records, as well as abatement messages when resource alarm event records have been cleared.

The analysis will correlate resource alarm event notifications to planned outage notifications to remove false resource alarm event notifications arising as a result of the planned outage activity.

These processes may determine that a resource alarm event notification may represent a service impacting condition. In these circumstances this process is responsible for indicating a potential service problem to the Service Problem Management processes. As a part of this indication this process is responsible for identifying the impacted service instances associated with the resource instances presenting alarm event notifications and passing this information to the Service Problem Management processes.

The supplier/partner inventory maintains records of all commercial arrangements with parties, and any modifications to them. It also records all details of contacts with parties as well as commercial information, including details of Business Partner products and services, required to support Business Partner Requisition Management and other processes.

The Business Partner inventory is also responsible for maintaining the association between product instances, service instances, resource instances and Business Partner product instances, created as a result of the Business Partner Requisition Management processes.

Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
•Identifying the inventory-relevant information requirements to be captured to support the Business Partner Relationship Management and other processes;
•Identifying, establishing and maintaining Business Partner inventory repository facilities;
•Establishing and managing the Business Partner inventory management and information capture processes;
•Managing the registration and access control processes that enable processes to create, modify, update, delete and/or download Business Partner data to and from the Business Partner inventory;
•Ensuring the inventories related to other parties repository accurately captures and records all identified supplier/partner details, through use of automated or manual audits;
•Tracking and monitoring of the usage of, and access to, the supplier/partner inventory repository and associated costs, and reporting on the findings

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Release & Deployment Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Release and Deployment Management includes all of the processes required to package, build, test and deploy a new or changed service into the live environment.  This means that service delivery is managed across any service provider interfaces.

•Terminology•
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Release  – eTOM Product Release, Service Release, Resource Release
ITIL Service – eTOM CFS and RFS distinction

Change Management optimizes risk exposure, minimize any business disruption and to ensure that anything released into the live environment goes right the first time.  With these as the drivers Change Management should reduce risk and therefore deliver direct benefit to the business.
Change Management aims to ensure that all changes to the IT infrastructure are assessed and enacted in a controlled manner, i.e.:
Standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes
All changes to service assets and configuration items are recorded in the Configuration Management System
Overall business risk is optimized.
The goals of ITIL Change Management are to:
Respond to the customer’s changing business requirements while maximizing value and reducing incidents, disruption and re-work
Respond to the business and IT requests for change that will align the services with the business needs.
The objective of the ITIL Change Management process is to ensure that changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner.

•Terminology•
There is no specific eTOM term for changes or associated ITIL terms such as change request, change record, or change advisory board.  Instead, eTOM generically refers to “changes” in various processes.  ITIL terminology includes: 
ITIL Change – The actual change that is proposed and possibly carried out is conceptually referred to as an ITIL Change.  This is the generic term, which may refer to the ITIL Change Request, ITIL Change Record, the change that is carried out, or all three.
ITIL Change Request – All changes are submitted as an ITIL Change Request, which may also be called an ITIL Request for Change. 
ITIL Change Record – After an ITIL Change Request is submitted and accepted, all documentation related to that ITIL Change Request is captured in an ITIL Change Record. • ITIL Change Advisory Board – A team that meets to assess an ITIL Change Request and recommend its authorization or rejection.• ITIL Change Authority – The individual or team that has the power to enact or reject an ITIL Change Request.  • ITIL Standard Change – A well-known type of change for which a simple, straightforward procedure can be carried out to enact the change. These changes are often expedited and do not require explicit authorization.  For example, a request to add a user to a security group may be an ITIL Standard Change.  It may also be called an ITIL Pre-approved Change.

The identified risks may be physical or logical/virtual. Successful risk management ensures that the enterprise can support its mission critical operations, processes, applications, communications in the face of a serious incident, from security threats/violations and fraud attempts. The Enterprise Risk Management processes deal with issues surrounding business continuity, security and fraud.  Where those risks can be managed within the context of the enterprise they are managed.  However there are some risks which are outside of the ability of the enterprise to reduce.  In those circumstances external insurance can give some comfort to the enterprise, and so the area of insurance management is a key element. A key aspect of risk management is an independent assessment that the identified controls are in place and working effectively.  This independent assessment is provided by the Audit Management processes. In many enterprises the area of credit management can be incorporated within the Enterprise Risk Management processes.

In the information and communications technology industry, the issuing of credit and credit assessment is intimately tied with the operational processes surrounding the identification and management of customers. In the eTOM Business Process Framework, credit management processes are therefore placed within the Customer-Ops horizontal process grouping.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,2,,,,,,,2,1.7,1
Business Continuity Management,(3) eTOM Task,1.7.2.1,1.3.2.1,"Business Continuity Management processes manage the development of strategies, policies, plans, organizational roles & responsibilities, and escalation procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the event of serious and/or sustained interruption.

These processes have four major aspects:
• Business continuity planning which provides for the proactive planning and testing of business and operational procedure continuity;
• Infrastructure recovery planning which provides for the pro-active determination of recovery and backup procedures for all key infrastructure capabilities, and their proactive testing;
• Serious incident management planning which defines the operational roles and responsibilities, and proactively defines the operational procedures and escalation criteria which are initiated when abnormal operation circumstances occur
• Business continuity management methodologies, which ensure consistent application of business continuity management across the enterprise.

Security Management,(3) eTOM Task,1.7.2.2,1.3.2.2,"Security Management processes assess threats to the enterprise and provide capabilities and controls to minimize the threats identified. These processes are responsible for setting Security Management corporate policies, guidelines, best practices and auditing for compliance by the enterprise.  In the information and communications technology (ICT) service provider domain, Security Management is a systematic and continuous series of processes and behaviors which assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Enterprise’s critical ICT assets. For ICT service providers, such assets can also include customer and partner data and resources.  Effective Security Management is essential for an ICT service provider to meet its fiduciary and legal obligations, business/mission objectives, and customer expectations.  Security Management addresses both internal and external sources of security threats as it provides computer network protection and defensive services.  Security Management processes include:1) Prevention;  2) Monitoring ; 3) Analysis; 4) Detection 5) Incident Management.

Security management deals with enterprise exposure to loss of value or reputation through threats or security violations.  Proactive Security Management processes identify areas of threat to the enterprise (covering both internal and external sources of threat), and monitor industry trends and best practice approaches to ensure that the enterprise remains at the forefront of security management threat minimization. Areas of threat can be physical (e.g. break-ins or terrorist incident, inappropriate use of network) or logical (e.g. inappropriate access to and use of information technology). The processes support the categorization and prioritization of areas of threat. These processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and procedures to be followed and provide assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate physical infrastructure, procedures and monitoring capabilities.  Reactive Security management processes deal with the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operation activity, analysis of monitored activity to detect potential threats/security violations, and forensic investigations to determine whether the potential threat is imminent or a security violation has occurred, and the potential or actual perpetrators.

Security Management processes interface to external security, police and/or investigative organizations.  These processes strongly interact with Fraud Management and have common elements and information services and communications specific elements.   Security Management processes are implemented at many levels of the enterprise and at the user, system/network, etc. levels.

Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for IT Service Continuity Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
IT Service Continuity Management operates in support of overall Business Continuity Management within the enterprise to ensure that the IT systems and support are available within the business, and to recover and restore IT service as required and agreed when service interruptions arise. The IT Service Continuity Manager will carry out a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for all existing and new services and will then ensure that the results are included within the IT Service Continuity Plan which will be aligned to the Business Continuity Plan.  This process is also responsible for carrying out risk assessments to ensure that these risks can be mitigated to prevent a disaster situation if it is justifiable to do so.

•Terminology•
The use of “Service” in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise’s customers) will map to Product. ITIL IT Services represent a subset of the services recognized within ITIL, which also identifies Business Services that these IT Services support and contribute to.

Information Security Management addresses the safety and integrity of information within the enterprise, and aims to satisfy a Service Level Agreement that has been established with the owners/users of the information concerning these aspects. Issues involved include the availability of the information, and maintaining its integrity and confidentiality as required and agreed. More generally, Information Security Management relates to IT Service Continuity Management, since information security will form part of the overall approach for IT service continuity. The Information Security Manager is responsible for developing and managing the Security Policies and also ensuring that they are enforced.

1. Internal audiences:  Other departments as necessary to support fraud investigations and corrective actions, and senior business owners, stakeholders, and executives to illustrate progress, risks, and needs to increase effective protection around the business
2. External audiences:  Other operators through the course of information sharing (e.g., fraud types and tactics to protect, investigative needs, etc.), and LEAs for purposes of managing more significant threats and fraud generating individuals and syndicates.

Fraud Operations is divided into 3 primary functional groups:  Information and Data Processing, Fraud Analysis, and Fraud Actions.

Gather Intelligence,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.2.9.3.1,1.3.2.3.3.1,"Intelligence Gathering is one of two primary proactive process groups by which fraud management practices are able to aggressively address fraud issues, preferably before those issues are executed against the operator.  Intelligence gathering processes and methods serve as one of the operator’s first lines of defense to fraud attacks, and are a critical path to understanding threats currently outside the operator’s business.  Four sub processes comprise Intelligence Gathering:

1. External Sources:  Intelligence about fraud attacks, methods to detect, methods to correct, and possible legality issues are collected and managed within this process step.  Sources may include:
a. Other operators:  Collective information about fraud attacks is frequently shared between operators as a best practice to help protect everyone
b. LEAs:  Law Enforcement Agencies – where information about legality of the threats, punishment available by law, methods to detect, etc., may be obtained
c. Industry support bodies:  Fraud protection forums including TM Forum, GSM Fraud Forum, CFCA, FIINA; Credit bureaus
d. Other industries:  General utilities, healthcare, insurers, etc., where identity theft practices and other frauds also occur
2. Customer Behavior Analysis:  By understanding behaviors that lead to fraud activity, patterns associated with these behaviors can be identified and isolated.  Once isolated, patterns of activities across all customers may be monitored for similar patterning that would lead to alarms and analysis much earlier in an attempted fraud activity.
3. Customer Contacts:  Frequently fraud activities conducted by an individual or syndicate (defined for this instance as an organized group) will also involve other parties that may not be directly associated with the fraud, but are knowledgeable of the activity.  While the individual(s) initiating the fraud may be isolated and the attack halted, care should be taken to understand the associated parties within the communications patterns of the initiating fraudsters.  Attacks may resume via these individuals, and therefore close monitoring of this chain of parties is warranted.  Note that none of these individuals (that either started the attack or were part of the communications patterns) may be direct customers of the targeted operator.
4. Whistleblower:  A “Whistleblower” is defined as an individual that identifies fraud activity to an operator.  This individual is most often an internal employee (revealing internal fraud activity), but may also be an external party otherwise unaffiliated with the operator.  Several operators have encouraged internal whistle blowing by offering incentives as part of normal operator policy to reward those people that bring fraud attacks to the attention of the fraud management team.","Intelligence Gathering is the process by which threats to the business are understood via information analysis from a variety of sources, both internal and external.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,2,9,3,1,,,,5,1.7.2.9.3,1
Reduce and Avoid Threat,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.2.9.3.2,1.3.2.3.3.2,"Threat Reduction and Avoidance is the second of two primary proactive processes (along with the aforementioned Intelligence Gathering) to minimize the risk of possible fraud attacks.  Within this process several protective steps are taken to ensure risk to the business is mitigated as much as possible as an ongoing practice.  Three sub processes comprise the carrier’s ability to reduce and avoid threats:

1. Propagate Black Lists:  As fraud attacks are identified and confirmed, those individual(s) and any aliases are collected and managed within black lists.  These lists should be used as a tool to protect the operator against re-issue of services to those on the list.  Understanding that the list will be in a constant state of growth over time, an operator will undoubtedly encounter a black listed name belonging to a completely unassociated and innocent individual.  Consequently, operators should consider investigation of those cases prior to denial of services, in hopes of not excluding legitimate, non-fraud customers.
2. Staff Vetting:  Operators should conduct thorough background and security checks on individuals that will have access to sensitive and otherwise vulnerable areas within the operator’s business (access to network systems, billing systems, customer records and accounts, financial data, etc.).  Internal fraud is a substantial threat to every operator, and depending on the employee’s area of access, periodic re-checks of backgrounds of existing employees is not unreasonable.
3. Customer Education:  Certain fraud types are often unable to be blocked by operators, and may victimize an operator’s customer base while also causing loss to the operator (e.g., customer credits given).  In these situations, proactive steps should be initiated by the operator to educate their customer base on behavioral changes and/or methods that will help to prevent these fraud types from occurring.  This may be in the form of press releases, PSAs (Public Service Announcements), and even direct customer contacts.
4. Risk Reviews:  Risk Reviews are conducted throughout the business on recurring, non-standard intervals.  Risk reviews should focus on threats and vulnerabilities across (at least) the following targets within the operator’s business:
a. Current operations and processes
b. Proposed new operational processes
c. Current products
d. Proposed new products
e. New systems within the network
f. Etc.","Threat Reduction and Avoidance is the process by which threats are identified in a proactive manner, to minimize risk to the business prior to an attempted attack.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,2,9,3,2,,,,5,1.7.2.9.3,1
Manage System Configuration,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.2.9.3.3,1.3.2.3.3.3,"System Configuration Management is responsible for generating, implementing, and maintaining all critical lists and rules libraries.  This process must remained tightly interfaced with the fraud analysis and determination activities to ensure lists are maintained as current, and that rules are properly deployed and utilized.  Three primary sub processes are driven within System Configuration Management:

1. Hot Lists:  Hot lists contain patterns of activity and behavior of past fraudsters.  These patterns may be analyzed against current patterns of activities within the network to detect re-emergence of fraud activity.
2. Black Lists:  These list(s) contain names/identities of prior known fraudsters, and should be continually checked against new subscribers.  This should also include altered identities through a variety of methods.
3. Rules Library and Configurations:  All rules associated with fraud detection are maintained within this sub process.  The challenge facing operators with rules management goes beyond the simple configuration of rules; an operator must also continue to review rule performance (ability to capture fraud, sensitivity to capture fraud vs. creating “false positive” alerting, etc.).  Additionally, rules are constantly changing and growing based on changing dynamics in networks, products, systems, internal processes, subscriber base, etc. 
4. Alarm threshold management:  Based on results of Fraud Determination (within process identifier 1.2.2), threshold adjustments will need to made to either correct for “false positive” alarming, or to increase threshold sensitivity to detect additional suspected fraud situations.  This process connection is illustrated within figure 5 “Overall Process Diagram”.",System Configuration Management serves as the support process to maintain critical reference and configuration data.

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Problem Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
ITIL Problem Management is driving to find the root cause of a problem.  This is not about fixing something quickly but about ensuring that the fix is permanent once it is implemented.  The Problem Manager will maintain information on problems, fixes and workarounds and links in very closely with Knowledge Management processes.

•Terminology•
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, each problem is qualified according to its layer of origin. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as a Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.
From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.
In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and  ITIL Service Request.
ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.
ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported. These are managed within this process.
ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Service Asset and Configuration Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Service Asset and Configuration Management identifies, controls, records, reports and verifies the service assets and Configuration Items (CIs) in order to support the business and customer’s control objectives and requirements.  The key point within this area is that it considers all Service Assets and not just hardware and software.
Service Asset and Configuration Management aims to:
• Identify, control, record, report, audit and verify service assets and configuration items, including versions, baselines, constituent components, their attributes, and relationships
• Account for, manage and protect the integrity of service assets and configuration items (and, where appropriate, those of its customers) through the service lifecycle by ensuring that only authorized components are used and only authorized changes are made
• Protect the integrity of service assets and configuration items (and, where appropriate, those of its customers) through the service lifecycle
• Ensure the integrity of the assets and configurations required to control the services and IT infrastructure by establishing and maintaining an accurate and complete Configuration Management System.

The goals of Configuration Management are to:
• Support the business and customer’s control objectives and requirements
• Support efficient and effective Service Management processes by providing accurate configuration information to enable people to make decisions at the right time, e.g. to authorize change and releases, resolve incidents and problems faster. 
• Minimize the number of quality and compliance issues caused by improper configuration of services and assets
• Optimize the service assets, IT configurations, capabilities and resources.

The objective is to define and control the components of services and infrastructure and maintain accurate configuration information on the historical, planned and current state of the services and infrastructure.

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Event Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Event Management aims to detect IT infrastructure events and determine the appropriate response to them.  Not all events require a response, but some do. Some responses may be automated, although some may require manual intervention. Event Management provides the ability to detect events, to make sense of them and to determine the most suitable control activity.  This depends on monitoring but should not be considered as just that, monitoring provides information on everything, event management provides meaningful information and notifications. 

•Terminology•
Both ITIL and eTOM use the term “event” in similar ways.  However, the term “event” needs to be used in other areas where ITIL Event Management can be integrated, including those listed in the following section.  In addition, eTOM uses the terms “problem” and “trouble” to refer to many things, including events.  This is a source of potential confusion, so the distinctions between ITIL and eTOM usage in this area should be kept in mind.

Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each takes of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Service – compared with SID Resource Facing Service and Customer Facing Service, ITIL Service is defined as services serving one business unit, multiple business units or business external to the enterprise; by convention we should identify the first two as RFS and the latter as CFS.

•Terminology•
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each takes of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.

From the eTOM perspective, each incident is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, an incident created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Incident, etc. (Similarly, this qualification by layer is applied to the identification of the underlying problem. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as an Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.)From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.

In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.
ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.
ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.
ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.

ITIL Request Fulfillment ensures that Service Requests are fulfilled in a controlled and timely manner, most of these service requests are actually changes to the service but due to the small scale impact and frequency it makes sense to take them out of the change management process.  The models used for request fulfillment must be signed off by change management before they are used to ensure that there are no risks to the service or environment by implementing them.

ITIL Continual Service Improvement,(3) eTOM Task,1.7.3.14,1.3.3.14,"Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at:
http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx ,
Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for CSI (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Continual Service Improvement represents pro-active mechanisms to help an organization to improve and realize benefits in terms of ROI (return on investment) and VOI (value on investment) along with intangible benefits of customer and staff satisfaction increasing. Note that while there may be a central focus for CSI within an organization, typically the activities to improve should form part of everyone’s roles.  Everyone within the organization needs to be empowered to suggest improvement ideas and those who actually run the processes or areas of business affected by an Improvement activity should be expected to implement the solutions.

•Terminology•
The use of “Service” in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise’s customers) will map to Product.

Fraud Management,(3) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2,1.3.2.3,"This process ensure real-time screening of transaction activity across users, accounts, processes and channels, to identify and prevent internal and external fraud in an organization.  The objective of the Fraud  in general is to detect fraud risks, activities, and other violations, as well as to detect and prevent the re-surfacing of known fraudulent activities, individuals, and syndicates.  
Fraud  is chartered within an operator to conduct 2 primary functions within the operator’s business model:  Create and maintain a fraud policy (enabling methods, activities, and other procedures to detect,  prevent, and manage discovered fraud instances within the operator), and support of fraud operations (creation and  of rules, lists, tools/solutions used for detections, staff education, etc.).  
The objective of the Fraud  in general is to detect fraud risks, activities, and other violations, as well as to detect and prevent the re-surfacing of known fraudulent activities, individuals, and syndicates.  Proactive detection processes are preferable to reactive mitigation and  of existing fraud, hence the importance of policy and support functions to provide tools to operational components in the enterprise to prevent fraud before it becomes harmful to the business. Inevitably, reactive processes must also be supported, as fraud tactics are in a continual state of change, posing a constant threat to operators.","Establish an enterprise-wide fraud  policy framework, and an associated operational capability aimed at identifying and preventing internal and external fraud in an organization.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,,,,,,3,1.7.9,1

Depending on the product offerings, geographic region served, demographics of the subscriber base, partner (e.g., wholesale) environment, internal network structure, budget, and other factors, fraud policies will vary across operators, with unique requirements for fraud policies prevalent in each case.  Practices and processes for detection, investigation, ongoing education, tool uses, feedback of identified frauds, external interactions (partners, LEAs), etc. comprise areas within scope of Fraud Policy .","Establish and manage all intra-team, enterprise-wide, and external facing policies to facilitate detection, management, and prevention of fraudulent activities",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,,,,,4,1.7.9.2,1
Manage Tool Policies,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.1.1,1.3.2.3.1.1,"The objective of Tool Policy Management is to provide oversight to the entire lifecycle of a fraud tool or solution within the organization.  This includes several key components:

1. Identification of the need for a tool or solution.  This will include the creation of business case materials needed to support the need for investment in technology to replace manual operations or enhance volumes of data being analyzed, etc.  This process will also be the origination point for requirements vetting, collecting, and aggregation into RFx issuance, and the subsequent review and scoring of responses received.
2. Deployment scope and project management of any tool or solution.  While the operator often contains an internal PMO for deployment activities/oversight, actual requirements needed by the Fraud program must be represented and ensured by the policy process. 
3. Staff preparation.  Use of technology requires training in both the use of the technology and the fraud domain itself to understand rules and processes being employed by tools.  The policy process must identify and maintain the necessary staff requirements to operate tools to the full extent of their deployed capabilities.
4. Ongoing process and rule enhancement.  Tools are subject to modifications and enhancements necessary to address constant changes within the fraud environment.  The policy process must maintain guidelines on when rules and processes may be enhanced or updated.
5. Access to fraud tools and systems.  Tools within the fraud environment have access to particularly sensitive information that require increased levels of security.  Policies must be in place to determine who is allowed access to these tools, and specifically, what actions they are allowed to perform within these fraud tools.  For example, configuration of rules for detection should be performed by appropriate staff to ensure fair yet thorough application of any given rule.  General staff within an organization should not have access to this information or configuration capability.
6. Roadmap development.  As needs of the fraud program change, tool support inevitably must also evolve.  In cases where tool capabilities do not meet the needs for growth, requirements for enhancements must be maintained within the policy process, and made available to tool developers and/or to subsequent RFx issuing.  It is important to examine existing tools within other departments for possible integration or re-use as part of this process.","Establish and manage all policies related to the employment, use, and maintenance of tools and/or solution platforms used in fraud detection, investigation, and management.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,1,,,,5,1.7.9.2.1,1

Analysis and identification procedure policies may include M&P information covering:

- When an issue is eligible for investigation (e.g., meeting certain alarming criteria, having a high enough financial value, etc.). 
- How issues are prioritized once deemed eligible for investigation (ranking in work queue, assignment to rapid teams vs. longer term investigation teams, etc.)
- What investigative processes are involved (e.g., internal process investigation, external agency investigation, internal network or system investigation, etc.)
- Which individuals should conduct specific investigative steps (some steps may involve managerial levels for information access, etc.)
- What supporting information may be necessary to conduct investigative analysis
- What criteria should be met to deem an incident as actual fraud
- What follow-up actions or steps are taken at the close of an incident (rules changes, policy changes, process changes, etc.)

Manage Fraud Classification,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.1.3,1.3.2.3.1.3,"The management and control of fraud classification information is an ongoing effort within any operator.  Not only is this information constantly growing internally within any given operator, but the available information externally is growing even more rapidly (other operators, industry standards and bodies, LEAs, etc.).  Management of this information is critical to the success and efficiency of any fraud protection program.

Internal management tasks:
1. Collection and version control of detected and confirmed frauds
2. Management of M&Ps (Methods and Procedures) around each fraud type to:
a. Detect (e.g., applicable rules)
b. Investigate 
c. Resolve (external interactions with LEAs, service interruptions, etc.)

External management tasks:
1. Access to fraud classifications and detection practices within the industry
2. Access to fraud types that do not match the operator’s business model - fraud appearing in mobile technology may soon arrive in varied form in IPTV, for instance.  Access to a “library” of other fraud information will only benefit an operator over time.  Examples that may be shared within a library include:
a. Hotlist B Database
b. New fraud patterns
c. New security and/or business loopholes exploited by fraudsters",This process serves as a repository of all fraud classifications pertinent to the operator’s business model.,Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,3,,,,5,1.7.9.2.1,1

Manage LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Interaction Policies,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.1.5,1.3.2.3.1.5,"Fraud teams will, from time to time, find it necessary to interact with LEAs for the purposes of investigating suspected fraud, understanding the scope of a fraud, understanding the legality of a fraud, assisting LEAs in placing a financial value on a fraud (to determine level of prosecution available), and to understand the syndicated network that may be involved.  Several pieces of information must be maintained within this process, including:

1. Criteria for when LEAs should be involved in fraud response activities, including materials that may be supplied to support investigations without breaching confidentiality, etc.
2. Criteria under which the operator can and should assist LEAs in their investigations (not initiated by the operator), including materials that may be supplied, confidentiality restrictions, SLAs, cost sharing, etc.
3. Specific contacts within LEAs that may be utilized as liaisons
4. Cases under which certain LEA jurisdictions should be contacted (e.g., city, regional, national, or international LEAs)
5. Cases under which multiple levels of LEAs may be required to be engaged

In situations where simple service interruption or collection actions are not enough to resolve the magnitude of a fraud case, LEAs serve as a valuable asset to not only compel fraudsters to cease activities and provide restitution, but to also prosecute more serious offenses and seize equipment, technology, and information that may have been used to perpetrate the fraud.",This process serves as a repository of  M&P (Methods and Procedures) information for interactions with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs).,Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,5,,,,5,1.7.9.2.1,1

Considering the number of operators globally today, there is a vast amount of information around fraud types, methods, detection practices, etc., that (if available between operators) could save considerable time, money, and effort within any given operator.  However, policies do need to be in place to guard against the sharing of sensitive information that could, in fact, harm the sharing operator.  This may include information that could benefit a competitor or trading partner, causing financial loss, decrease in market share, or exposure of competitive advantage.",This process serves as a repository of M&P (Methods and Procedures) information for interactions with External Operators.,Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,6,,,,5,1.7.9.2.1,1
Manage Internal Ethics Policies,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.1.7,1.3.2.3.1.7,"The success of an operator is determined by many factors.  One of the key factors relates to the experience and conduct of the internal staff.  Certain actions by internal staff could result in harm to the operator in terms of financial loss, loss of customers, or loss of sensitive internal information.  Policies need to be constructed and maintained within the operator that outline the conduct that is expected of employees, and also what is considered a breach, or violation, of that conduct.  Additionally, penalties associated with breach or violation should also be explained within these policies (e.g., prosecution, termination, etc.).  Specific policy areas to address include, but are not limited to:
 
1. Internal communications
2. Partner communications
3. Customer communications
4. System access and use

This overall set of policies should be in the form of a document signed by all employees, and maintained within their employee records.

Additional policies should also be maintained for Fraud Team members within the operator.  These policies should be included within an addendum document, signed by each Fraud Team member.  While all employees will have signed conduct agreements, staff working within a Fraud department will have access to particularly sensitive systems and information relating to internal and external fraud issues, which will require an increased level of confidentiality, privacy, and most importantly, security, beyond what general staff will be held accountable.","This process contains specific policies relating to internal staff conduct, and outlines what may be determined as a breach of that conduct and associated penalties.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,1,7,,,,5,1.7.9.2.1,1
Fraud Operations Support,(4) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.2,1.3.2.3.2,"Fraud Operations Support has a primary role as a preventative entity within Fraud Operations overall.  The Support process objective is to enable the ongoing detection, investigation and actions functions of Fraud Operations but also to support, in a proactive manner, the threats identification and Fraud avoidance functions through preventative information collection, monitoring the business for changes (and counsel the business when those changes expose a threat for fraud) and to manage fraud learnings back into the business via list , rule enhancements, etc.","Fraud Operations Support serves as the enabling function for fraud prevention, ongoing fraud detection, and overall threat reduction practices.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,2,,,,,4,1.7.9.2,1
Process Information and Data,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.2.1,1.3.2.3.2.1,"Fraud operations in general should be receiving data almost continuously, and analysis of the received data should take place without delay where possible.  Earlier processing and/or analysis of datasets enables not only more rapid detection of fraud, but also the subsequent ability to take meaningful action to stop fraudulent activities before (any) damage is incurred by the business.  There are 3 primary functional areas within this process to address and define:

1. Rule Processing:  During rule processing activities, information and data is passed through rules either through automated (technology-based) means or other manual processes.  Depending on the volume of data and the complexity of the rules (interdependencies, aggregated or weighted triggering, etc.), increasing levels of technology will be necessary to quickly implement rules against data and determine the results.
2. Alert Generation:  Configuration of alerts.  Alerts may be generated when certain expected conditions are not met, including missing dataset delivery, failure to act on investigation requests (escalations), etc.  Alerts may also be issued when certain conditions are exceeded, including excessive alarm quantities resulting from “loose” rules producing false positive results.
3. Alarm Generation:  Configuration of alarms.  Alarms are typically the result of detected events or activities that are suspicious and should be investigated as possible fraud.  Alarms may be the result of single rule violations, or of multiple rule violations that contribute to weighted levels of suspicion (more complex scenario) etc.

Other functions may also include the configuration of supplementary reports for scenarios not configured through rules and alarms as listed above.

The configuration of rules, alerts, and alarms should be governed by policies as described in the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.  Additionally, the procedures that should be followed as a result of the issuance of an alert or alarm should be governed by policies as described within the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.","This process is the ongoing processing of information and data against rules designed to detect threats, and the subsequent alerts and alarms resulting from rule violations and other detection processes.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,2,1,,,,5,1.7.9.2.2,1
Analyze Fraud,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.2.2,1.3.2.3.2.2,"Fraud Analysis is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities conducted by the analysis team.  Each sub process is part of a linear flow that also includes feedback into action and support processes, as described below.

1. Alarm Assessment:  As data processing triggers alarms of suspected fraud, the assessment activity is the first point at which initial triage of the alarm(s) is conducted.   During the assessment, the analyst should determine, based on business rules, the initial validity of the alarm, a priority of the alarm (based on value, affected systems, or other criteria), and the appropriate team that would need to address the alarm (e.g., billing, wholesale partner, network, etc.).
2. Alarm Investigation:  Once initial assessment has occurred, the alarm is then forwarded to an investigation activity that typically begins as an internal function.   During investigation additional data may be accessed, scope of the issue may be ascertained, and an overall understanding of the issue will need to be achieved before determining whether the issue is, in fact, fraud.  During this process initial actions may be invoked (e.g., disrupted service) to prevent further loss/risk prior to customer contact and/or fraud determination work.
3. Contact Customer:  Once internal investigations have gathered all information available, a customer contact may be necessary to understand customer intention, validity of the subscriber, etc.  This is the final process performed prior to reaching a fraud decision.  If no customer is directly involved, this step may not be necessary (e.g., Dealer Fraud, Internal Fraud).
4. Fraud Determination:  Once all information is collected from internal and external investigations, a fraud determination is made.  If the decision is that the issue is not fraud, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Fraud Actions process (1.2.3) for closure, and the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to possibly avoid recurrence of this alarm condition.  If the decision is that the issue is, in fact fraud, similar subsequent activities will occur:  First, the issue is referred to the Fraud Actions (1.2.3) process to properly handle actions to stop the fraud, initiate collections and legal actions, etc.  Second, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to hotlists, blacklists, and any refinement needed to possibly capture the issue more rapidly.
5. Recording and Reporting:  After the determination is made as fraud or not fraud, activities associated with the analysis are finally passed into recording of actions, and reporting of recoveries, time to capture and correct, and preventative actions now in process.","This process is the ongoing activity of investigating, diagnosing, and implementing controls to both prevent fraud and minimize existing fraud impacts.",Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,2,2,,,,5,1.7.9.2.2,1
Perform Fraud Actions,(5) eTOM Task,1.7.9.2.2.3,1.3.2.3.2.3,"Fraud Actions is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities to be performed based on the issue being determined as fraud or not fraud.  Each sub process is capable of being a stand-alone process (not dependent on other Actions sub processes), however more than one of these Actions may be used to help bring any given issue to appropriate closure.

1. No Action:  If an issue is determined to not be fraud, the issue is closed and archived as part of this process.  Concurrent flows to Support and Reporting have also occurred to adjust rules, etc., as a result.  No further action is required.  Note:  A feedback to the System Configuration Management process should be considered in this case, for possible alarm threshold adjustment, whitelist updates, etc.  This process path is denoted in Figure 5:  “Overall Process”.
2. Adjust Customer Billing:  Certain fraud instances result in customers being the victim in addition to the operator.  In these cases, extent of customer damage needs to be quickly ascertained and corrected in the customer’s billing and/or services.  While the determination of the damage is typically performed by the fraud team, the actual Customer Billing corrective action is usually performed by a Customer Care Team, based on information forwarded by the Fraud Team.
3. Legal or LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Action:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and significant financial loss, contract breach, or other illegal activities have occurred, the operator may seek recourse via the legal system.  This may be via civil reparations and/or criminal charges.  This sub process will utilize the operator’s policies (1.1.5) to determine whether attorney, law enforcement, or other assistance is needed.  This sub process will also use the same policies to determine and collect supporting information that will be necessary for those external agencies to properly pursue their activities.
4. Terminate Customer:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and the operator deems the issue to be of enough magnitude to warrant termination, this process will conduct the termination of the customer (e.g., initiate the disconnect order).
5. Dismiss Staff:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and/or a substantial violation of internal operator policies and internal staff have been found responsible, termination of the staff may be initiated at this step.  Fraud team findings for ethics policy violations, fraud investigative results, etc., should be forwarded to Human Resources, where appropriate actions will be initiated.  Of important note:  Staff negligence resulting in fraud is sometimes inappropriately diagnosed as intentional when, in fact, accidental actions may have exposed the operator to the fraud.  Care should be taken to fully understand the circumstances around which the internal employee’s actions caused or help cause the fraud.  
6. Process Change:  If an issue is determined to be fraud, future preventative steps may include business process change in addition to fraud detection rule enhancements.  Business process may have, in fact, allowed the fraud to occur, therefore the first step in prevention should happen well before a rule should capture the condition.  This process will need to interface with the business to identify candidates for process change and present those to the appropriate business stakeholders.",This process contains all possible actions necessary to manage an issue following determination as fraud or not fraud.,Enterprise Domain,,4,Released,1,7,9,2,2,3,,,,5,1.7.9.2.2,1
