1,1,,End-to-End Business Streams,,,"Generally, a service provider can be structured into core business processes, as well as control and support processes. One perspective that can be useful for the core business processes is to view these as consisting of the Customer Centric processes and three additional process areas: Customer, Product and Network. These can be seen to represent process domains arranged as end-to-end business streams which show a focus across the Service Provider for the area of business activity concerned. Note that the use of the terms “process domains” and “end-to-end business streams” here is just intended to explain this broad business context and is not a new element of structure or terminology within the core Business Process Framework.
In this model, the Customer Centric processes are characterized as being initiated by the customer and ending at the customer. Additionally, the processes involved include all other core processes, which are not directly initiated by a customer (e.g. marketing campaign, product lifecycle management, network operations).

The Customer Centric processes have several interactions with the other three process areas/domains. For instance, they might be initiated by relevant activities in the sense of CRM at the Customer domain, and interactions may include trouble solving in the Network domain and the Product domain.

5,1,1,Engaged Party Flows,,,"This section includes sample process-flows (eTOM level 3) relevant to the Engaged Party Flows. The process-flows show how to apply the Engaged Party Domain, a part of eTOM to six phases of procurement process.
We look at addressing the “Effective management of procurement process using Business Process Framework (eTOM)”.There are various processes in industry to carry out procurement, but doing it in a standard, well known, flexible approach will have a good value addition throughout procurement lifecycle.
Hence, we choose to decompose and identify standard business process from Engaged Party of Business Process Framework which can be easily mapped to various phases of procurement process. We may not be able to get one-to-one mapping of procurement phase against eTOM processes, however we can identify the applicable group of processes.

Likewise, there is always parallel need of standard, easy to adopt, industry-neutral process definition for procurement. The example defined in this document tries to address this and provide best practice that can be derived from business process framework.
The idea behind this case study is to provide a road map and best practices organizations can use during procurement process using standards defined in Frameworx.
As mentioned, this section decomposes/ identifies process involved till Level 3 of business process framework that can be mapped to various phases of procurement process.
",,,"In the scope of this example, process involving performance and problem reporting of external parties is not considered. This can be included as part of next versions of document. This case study was originally based on Frameworx 14.5 Model and was updated according to the latest 16.0 Model. Engaged party domain is considered throughout the case study (since the Supply partner domain was replaced with Engaged party domain). This process can be fully automated, but in some cases manual activities are also in scope.",,,,
