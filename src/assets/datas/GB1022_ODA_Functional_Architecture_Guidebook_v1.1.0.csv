DI,1,ODA,Decoupling & Integration,(1) ODA The Functional Blocks Type,,"The Decoupling & Integration (D&I) Block is about governing and managing separation of functional borders based on well-established ""families"" of closely interrelated services as well as the integration between them. D&I gathers non-business functions that are needed at design and runtime to enable the combinations of services that the business requires.
The Decoupling & Integration Block ensures that services provided by ODA can be combined in a flexible way, without restriction imposed by a process pattern derived from a given stack of blocks.
Note: Where in traditional architectures functional layers are supposed to communicate only with adjacent ones (e.g., BSS with OSS, OSS with Network but not BSS directly with Network). ""Decoupling"" within ODA emphasizes that ODA Function Blocks are not behaving like layers and tightly coupled together. This ensures that the functional architecture by itself doesn't preclude any combination of services.

EGM provides the capabilities to assure a digital, secure and accurate interaction of all these stakeholders, providing digital and omnichannel capabilities through the configuration of the different journeys reusing the processes and functionalities provided by the platform.
Its scope includes interactions between users and processes handled by other functions such as from the Intelligence Management, Party Management, Core Commerce Management or Production Blocks. “Users” from the perspective of EGM, may be machines and things (IoT context), humans (prospects, customers, users, employees, of people working on behalf of partners and suppliers - 3rd parties) that collaborate and integrate their own solutions to the ecosystem, providers of different services (retailers, salespeople, technical providers).

P,1,ODA,Production,(1) ODA The Functional Blocks Type,,"The Production Block is responsible for the delivery and lifecycle management of Customer Facing Services (CFS) and Resource Facing Services (RFS) regardless of the technology type (e.g., physical, virtual, connectivity, end point, etc.) or the operational domain or factory where it originates, including third parties.
The Production Block exposes its service capabilities in a way that is commonly known as Network as a Service (NaaS) for consumption by other ODA function blocks. For example, the Core Commerce Management Block uses them to create products and offers, while the Engagement Management Block uses them to allow customers to recharge their balance or order a new video on demand. The Production block may also expose devices (e.g., smartphone) and application capabilities (e.g., email).
The scope of the Production block includes the exposure of its service capability definitions and the dynamic run-time decision of how the service(s) supporting Products and Customer will be created, delivered, used, maintained, assured, and repaired.  It provides end-to-end management of operational functions for services and resources to support the commercial success of the ecosystem - including activities that span multiple enterprises such as the management of installation, deployment, and operations of technologies, performance and quality.
The Production Block does not need to know the details of a product nor the customer, contract owner, or payer requesting its exposed service capabilities. It assumes responsibility for the delivery of the CFS/RFS, as well as for operating the usage functions up to a committed quality of service - including applying policy control and  balance management and supplying the Core Commerce Management Block with usage data records to perform rating on offers.

Business Processes in the Production Function
The Production Block's business processes are based on a tactical operating model with no business architecture lock-in.
The business processes are derived from eTOM level 2 business process elements. The processes descriptions are derived from the following eTOM Groupings: Service Development and Management, Service Management and Operations, Resource Development and Management and Resource Management and Operations

IM,1,ODA,Intelligence Management,(1) ODA The Functional Blocks Type,,"Analytical processes use operational data (reference data) and events produced by operational processes or captured from the environment during an interaction with the enterprise (for instance, events related to the activity of a user on a portal, events generated by operating connected object or devices).
Analytical processes use operational data along with events received from operational processes to produce analyses, correlations and aggregations that yield a representation of operational reality. Analytical processes encompass activity or budget follow-up, as well as revenue assurance or fraud detection, based on traffic analysis.
Analytical processes can use very large amounts of data and in turn produce their own data (e.g., all kinds of KPI) for which they are entirely responsible  and which they may make available to other systems (either for display, or as input data for further processing).
Therefore, analytical processes are distinct from operational processes but interact with them through event exchanges and data sharing. Big and Fast data capabilities are expected to further develop such interactions and enhance operational processes.

ODA,0,,ODA The Functional Blocks ,(1) ODA The Functional Blocks Type,,"The Functional Architecture of ODA 
The ODA Function Blocks define the key functional grouping that logically establish related family of information systems objects. Through functional decomposition of the key capabilities of a digital business/digital enterprise, the Functional Architecture establishes a Level 0 Functional grouping that enables achieves business and operational agility.
The Functional Architecture is modeled to represent digital enterprise business operation, using functions that correspond to the interactions that go beyond the traditional pipe-line business model. Each of the ODA Function Blocks is an enterprise level group of functions with a collection of coherent processes continuously performed to enable digital business.


As a Level-0 Functional Architecture, the Function Blocks can be used to quickly develop various information systems operating models of a specific enterprise based on its mission - while maintaining alignment integration to the overall vision of a digital enterprise.
