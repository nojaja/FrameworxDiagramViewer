Direct Sales Force,(2) TAM Application Type,3.4.1,"The Direct Sales Force application is used by CSR’s, Field Sales, Sales Administrators, Analysts and Managers to generate/qualify sales opportunities, generate revenue, maintain and optimize the sales process, territories, quotas, view forecasts.
As a Customer Service Representative (CSR), you have first contact with potential customers. Incoming telephone calls and emails enable you to capture customer information and qualify leads according to the guidelines set by your company (cf Customer Information Management). If the lead satisfies your criteria, you can promote that lead to the status of a contact, and an opportunity. Sales opportunities are dispatched to sales representatives in the field to pursue if the size of the sale has the potential to exceed agreed monetary thresholds. If not, you can respond directly to customer inquiries by creating and dispatching literature requests and/or sales quotations. Orders are submitted for processing when you receive acceptance for the contract that has been negotiated with the customer (cf. Order Management).
A user of the Direct Sales application can have one of the following roles:
• Customer Service Representative (CSR). As a CSR or agent, you generate and qualify sales opportunities and dispatch leads to field sales representatives. Your primary method of communication with the customer is by phone and email. 
• Field Sales Representative. As a field sales representative, you create and manage customer accounts, develop sales opportunities, and generate revenue.

Retail Outlets,(2) TAM Application Type,3.4.3,"One of the primary sales channels for Wireless Communication Service Providers is the provider’s own retail stores. Currently, other communications sectors rely less on this channel due to the fact that non-Wireless services typically need to be physically installed on the customer’s premises, whereas in wireless communications the customer typically gets services instantly at the retail store/point of sale. Non-wireless services providers may use retail outlets as a means to complete an order (e.g., for customers that want to pick up a DSL modem from a retail outlet to complete their order in order to avoid payment of shipping costs).Retail stores are considered an extension of the call center in the sense that existing customers may walk in and ask for assistance in customer service issues (e.g., billing, how to operate their handset, etc.). In other words, Retail Stores are not only used as Point of Sale but also used as Point of Service.","Points of Sales Management

Dealers focus on acquiring new customers and upgrading existing customers. Most dealers are only a Point of Sale and not a Point of Service (as opposed to the Communication Service Provider’s owned retail stores). The dealer’s main focus is to acquire new customers or upgrade existing customers. The main need for a dealers online application is to make them self-sufficient and avoid the need for them to call the call center on behalf of a customer to activate their handset.","Commissioning Management

• Universal platform supporting multiple users (consumers& business& dealers) and multiple LOBs (wire line& wireless& IPTV) though single point of contact 
• Reducing costs through operating efficiencies 

These operations expect to gain more customer loyalty, service stickiness and ARPU for the service provider. A primary factor for increasing ARPU through self empowered systems is high usability. High usability requires channel agnostic consistency and seamless customer experience leveraging functionality that is driven from sporadic backend systems. For that, self empowered systems should provide integration readiness through several vehicles:

•  Pre-integrated self service system including stand-alone web framework or integration front end with a portal engine 
•  Self services layer exposing atomic Webservices/APIs for reuse by multiple systems across the architectural environment 
•  Portlets driven connectivity exposing data and services interoperability through a portal engine or web application. 

Typically the portal to the customer is via a web-based interface. Customer self care is increasingly popular with both customers and operators as it usually provides access to information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and does not have the frustration of waiting for a free call agent. Customer self-care systems can take a number of forms from a controlled ‘secure window’ application into the underlying OSS systems used internally by the operator for the customer to view and pay his invoices to a complete portal where the customer can manage his entire relationship with the operator. Customer Self Management applications need to provide a level of security to protect both the customer’s data and the integrity of the underlying systems. They should also be capable of providing single sign on capabilities to access Business and Operational Support Systems.",,Customer Domain,4,Released,5,4,,,,1,5,1

Service Inventory Management,(1) TAM Application Type,6.2,"Service Inventory Management represents the applications which contain and maintain information about the instances of services in a telecom organization.
A Service Inventory application may store and manage any or all of the following entities:
• Customer facing service (CFS) instances, and their attributes
• Resource facing service (RFS) instances, and their attributes
The Service Inventory may also store and manage service relationships:
• The mapping of services (RFSes or CFSes) to other services and/or service components, the components being either:
• Other child services
• Resources and the resource domain managers used to implement the service, or 
• Services and resources in Supplier/Partner systems used to implement the service 
This mapping is stored either intrinsically in the core Service Inventory, or discretely via Service-Supporting Resource Inventory applications.
Service Inventory may include the following relationship types between entity instances:
•         Realization by Composition – A mapping from a service to the child services and/or resources which specifically compose that service (e.g. the RFS instance or instances whose whole purpose is to implement a CFS, the assignable resources which realize an RFS). If a parent service is torn down, child objects with a Composition relationship are typically removed or reallocated (e.g. transitioned to spares inventory).
•         Realization by Aggregation – A mapping from a service to the services and/or resources which support this service in addition to other services. (e.g. a network access RFS which supports a number of different network CFSes). If a parent service is torn down, child objects with an Aggregation relationship are typically maintained as long as at least one other parent service still exists.
•         Dependency – A link between services and/or resources which is not strong enough to qualify as Composition or Aggregation, but where various Fulfillment, Assurance, and Change Management processes need to be aware of the relationship. Dependency relationships support the ability for change management processes to evaluate if a dependent service or resource may be impacted by changes to a specific service or resource.",,Service Domain,4,Released,6,2,,,,1,6,1
Service-Resource Inventory,(2) TAM Application Type,6.2.1,"Service-Resource Inventory is a shared function between Service Inventory and Resource Inventory, and, depending on the needs of an individual organization, may be implemented in a Service Inventory Management system, a Resource Inventory Management system, some combination of both, or even in a standalone application which bridges the gap between Service and Resource Inventory Management.
Service-Resource Inventory entails managing the relationship between RFSes and the resources and resource domain managers which implement the services on the network. Resources may all be directly managed by the carrier's Resource Inventory systems, or may also include references to resources from a Supplier/Partner asset management system.
Typically, this inventory does not track all possible network resources involved in delivery of the service (this is the realm of Resource Inventory Management systems themselves), but rather:
• Any stand-alone physical or logical resources whose assignment is critical to service fulfilment, and whose tracking is critical to service operations, assurance, and billing. Examples may include: modem or other special CPE equipment which may not be tracked directly as part of the provider network, static IP addresses and other network identifiers, etc.
• Assignment-level resources which represent a larger resource structure supporting the service, often referred to as an Access Point. Examples include: the ADSL DSLAM port assigned to a service, a data circuit service assigned customer facing router interface or subinterface, etc.
• In some cases, the Service-Supporting Resource Inventory may also track the domain manager applications (e.g. Resource Inventory and/or Activation systems) which manage the resource in question, although in a mature SOA implementation, the Service-Supporting Resource Inventory can often be agnostic of which resource layer systems actually master the resource data.","Service-Resource Relationship Management

Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization,(2) TAM Application Type,6.2.2,"This function entails reconciliation of the data in a Service Inventory Management system with inventory discovered from another source and/or synchronization of mismatched service inventory records. 

When new service inventory information is discovered, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will try to match the newly discovered information with an entity or entities already existing in the Service Inventory.

If no match is found, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will typically assume that a new entity has been discovered and add the entity to the inventory. Alternately, as decided by the service provider as part of their procedures, the Service Inventory Reconciliation system may record this event as an exception, implicitly or explicitly triggering a workflow to resolve the exception. For example, this may happen if the service provider always expects to have the planned service inventory in their Service Inventory Management systems before the actual services are activated.

If a match is found and there are no unexpected discrepancies, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will update the inventory as needed. For example, records may be updated to fill in missing attributes or update attribute values which have changed. If a match is found and there are unexpected discrepancies, the Service Inventory Reconciliation system will typically raise an exception so that service provider personnel can correct the problem.

Enterprise Application Integration,(1) TAM Application Type,10.1,"Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) is a business computing term for the plans, methods, and tools aimed at modernizing, consolidating, and coordinating the applications in an enterprise. EAI technology allows this integration to be done using techniques that leverage the architecture. Using these concepts, applications send or receive events / messages to or from other components or send or receive notifications. Such architecture provides greater degrees of freedom. For example, components can be replaced by new ones more easily as they have the same interface. It is also easier to plug-in a new component that will use the services already available. EAI includes:
• transport of data between applications
• data format translations
• implementation, at EAI level, of enhanced enterprise level objects
The following are two example solutions that can be found in the EAI sub-domain:
•         Managed File Transfer, referring to software for moving data, overcoming the limitations found in conventional FTP (e.g. support to multiple protocols, automation, security, auditability, monitoring, etc.).   
•         Cache and Distributed Caching, which goals are to provide performance and scalability to applications.
In the following sections, we start with a description of the analysis methodology and guidelines that are used in this section for the EA Integration of the focused applications. Use of this analysis methodology should reduce making inappropriate decisions based on expected capabilities associated with such architectures.
It must also be noted that Enterprise Integration is generally implemented in a number of successive phases. This is particularly true when few existing applications are already efficiently integrated together. It is recommended that the first phases usually consist in the integration of new features and new applications and that in further phases it can be envisaged to enhance the integration of the existing applications.","Event/Message Caching

Business Process Management & Workflow,(1) TAM Application Type,10.2,"Business Process Management (BPM) is the evolution of earlier concepts called workflow management (also known as Process Flow Management). As operators understand the need to introduce much greater flexibility and day-day change into their business processes, BPM and workflow management techniques, pioneered in manufacturing industry, are becoming more and more visible in the communications industry. 
Business flexibility is crucial for an operator as well as high levels of automation of its processes, not just of basic process flows but of complex and exception handling areas. One of the cardinal principles of Frameworx is to allow this by abstraction of business processes from application logic. The emergence of N-tier computing and component-oriented environments (such as COM and J2EE) allow for this principle in the same manner that the emergence of SQL and the two-tier client/server architecture enabled the abstraction of data management from application code. By separating business process management as an independent function, applications can be designed around existing processes, and thus to take advantage of shared business logic rather than reinventing and recoding it for each application.There are considerable benefits to an operator in adopting this type of approach and would include:Reduced costsStaff savingsCash flow improvementBetter customer perceptionFaster and more flexible response to implement new processes or amend existing ones to accommodate new products / servicesTo understand how BPM fits with an operator and its infrastructure, it is helpful to examine the individual components of BPM. While commercial implementations vary in their specific definitions and software composition, most fit within the basic framework described below. Note that although some systems offer the ability to automate activities and define business rules, those that lack the fundamental components below cannot realistically be used as a BPM system.A BPM system is defined by the components of:Execution EngineProcess Designer,Process DefinitionsActivity MonitorUser interface which may be a combination of a Windows client application, HTML based Work Portal, or an exposed API or Web serviceThe majority of BPM systems on the market today are component-oriented and allow each of the individual pieces listed above to be deployed independently on individual servers. Individual business processes are defined by the process owner in a Process Definition, (increasingly expressed in a standard language such as UML or some variation of XML). Each Process Definition may be composed of both manual activities and automated activities. Once defined and validated within the Process Designer, processes are instantiated by an Execution Engine. The Activity Monitor provides access to status and performance metrics on the execution of processes. End-to-end process ‘orchestration’It is unlikely that the implementation of a Frameworx based ‘lean’ migration program will be a ‘big bang’ type of approach implementing all new systems. Therefore, the Enterprise Integration Framework will need to integrate end-to-end processes across various ‘islands of automation’ ranging from existing legacy systems to new commercial-off-the-shelf technology. This approach is sometimes called ‘orchestration’ in process. An orchestration-based approach offers the ability to manage processes of greater complexity, (such as complex business service provisioning etc.) with far more efficiency than is otherwise possible with alternative approaches. The key to this is a modular approach to managing business rules, relationships, and activities.Within a simple workflow automation paradigm, processes are defined “end-to-end” with all possible paths (or more commonly a single path) pre-determined. Thus ‘Step 5’ always follows ‘Step 4’ and precedes ‘Step 6’ even if different instances of an otherwise standard process may require a different sequence.Orchestration allows for the sequencing of steps to be determined during the “run-time” instance of a process, with paths determined by evolving context resulting from each new step. Thus the potential number of paths and outcomes may otherwise be too complex to define in terms of pre-determined “If-Then-Else” rules, but may be easily resolved through human interaction and decision-making. This highlights the key architectural difference between automation and orchestration. Given the inherent complexity and constant changes within an operator’s business environment, effectively managing processes requires the agility to shift with changes in context, rather than always being bound to the same scripted flow. This requires the unique ability to define processes as a set of atomic, goal-based activities with the enforcement of basic parameters (e.g., time limits, data variables), while separating the execution logic activities from the higher-level process definition. Process orchestration is not limited to invoking software, but rather represents a shift from task-based to goal-oriented process definition. Web services and other forms of software automation are utilized through process orchestration, yet not to the exclusion of manual, human-driven activities.","BPM Activity Monitor

API Management,(1) TAM Application Type,10.3,"“APIBroker”, “APIGateway” or simply, “APIRuntime”

High-performance, scalable, and low latency engine capable of mediatingHTTPrequests betweenAPI consumers and service enablers;

Cache: Although completely optional to use, many times it is desirable or required to configure caching at the broker level for specific service enabler operation responses. By caching those responses, the broker can improve its responsiveness by reducing the number of requests to an underlying service enabler to whenever its responses are not already cached.
Mediation of high throughput ofHTTPrequests betweenAPIconsumers and services;
Awareness and support of Web protocols semantics (MIMEtypes,HTTPAuthorization and Caching headers, etc.);

Header transform: modifications of header names and/or header information (e.g., service enabler-specific header to IANA-based header)
Support of Data Format, Data Model transformations and Protocol Bridging between most or all common Web standards (WS-*,SOAP,XML, REST, JSON, etc.);

Parameter transform: modifications of parameter names and/or parameter values
Method transform: modifications of the method specified in API request (e.g., POST to DELETE)
Error information transform: modifications of error information in the body part of API response
Status code transform: modifications of status code in the API response (e.g., 302 “Found” to 303 “See Other”)
Information masking: filtering some information in the API response based on query parameters in API request or based on API provider’s policy
Abstraction: conceptually transformations of the meanings of parameters or decrease of the number of request parameters
Protocol transform: transformations of protocol to send API requests/responses (e.g., SOAP to REST)
Mash-up (Composition): assembling a new API with existing APIs provided by service enabler.
Content-based routing, fail-over, load balancing, and broadcasting of requests;

Route: The broker Route task is the most commonly used task in a broker. A service enabler consumer issues a request to a given service; the broker Route task is responsible for forwarding that request to its underlying service enabler. Beyond the basic behavior of routing, the Route task should allow the parameterization of request timeout, HTTP keep alive connection, HTTP basic or digest authentication, URL decode, HTTP X-Forwarded-For/Host/Server, HTTP referrer, exception shielding configuration, HTTP status code, content based routing by regular expressions or xPath, etc. 
Support of standard authentication and authorization protocols (WS-Federation, SAML, OAuth, etc.), for both internal and external applications,APIdevelopers and users;
Validate: The broker Validate task ensures that only valid messages (according to their contract’s schema) are routed to the remote host. This capability lowers dramatically the number of malformed messages that are presented to a given service enabler, and by doing so contributes to maximize the performance and scalability of that service enabler.
Policy, Charging ; Rules Function: The Broker decision task makes it possible to have decision trees within a workflow or policy evaluation, at any nesting level. This is the basis for many possible micro-workflow related activities, making possible to configure a decision point structure where multiple option are present. The values tested in those options can be static or dynamically retrieved at runtime from the broker runtime context or from any part of the currently processed message.
Diagnose: The Broker Diagnose task dynamically updates underlying management systems such as the Windows Management Instrumentation performance counters so that they can be monitored and reported upon by the monitoring service.
Log: The broker Log task enables the logging of any request or response at any time during the processing of a strategy. The task should be able to execute synchronously or asynchronously, and target a designated file system path, database server, HTTP URL, or email address. If configurable to run only for a specific request or response message of a specific user (or user role) the task can be targeted to a specific operation of a specific service enabler. These granularities together with the possibility to deliver the log information in different channels offer great flexibility for both operation and debug scenarios. 

CDR: creation of Call Detail Record for calculating API usage fee. 
Traffic Control: The broker limits the access from the valid service consumers based on the contract with service consumers or service enablers or based on the conditions of API broker itself or service enablers.

Flow control (Inbound): access limitations based on the contract between API provider and application developers (e.g., throughput/quota/concurrent connections limit)
Flow control (Outbound): access limitation based on the contract between API provider and service enablers or the conditions of service enablers (e.g., throughput/quota/concurrent connections limit)
Application Management: managing account information for recognizing applications (e.g., API key/OAuth2.0’s client_id, client_secret) and application developers. 
Data Encryption Key Management: managing data encryption keys to encrypt data in a case of sending sensitive data through API.
Market or Store: In order to accomplish the task of commercial or business mediation, the Broker can implement for itself or communicate to some other external marketplace / store service. For example the broker should be able to count and track requests for any given request or response, and optionally cause the broker to refuse serving any more requests for a specific user if a configured request limit per service consumer or if a configured time frame is reached.
Protect: The broker Protect task may impose access restrictions to some service consumers, in order to protect service enablers from abuse or undesired usage. Some common examples are the configuration of an IP address range restriction or a limit to the maximum message size accepted.
